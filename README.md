this is a fork of filebot

this fork aims to create an automated classificator for movies/series

my dream is the following:

to have a program which can automatically sort series/movies from the same folder into
specific output directories by type (because xbmc/kodi likes to have the separated, which is understandable)

something like:
	scanbot -src movies_and_series_folder --series-output-dir series --movies-output-dir movies

the tool is named scanbot inside the source, but its not ready yet.

i try hard to not change the filebot core functionalities and be able to merge those improvments
